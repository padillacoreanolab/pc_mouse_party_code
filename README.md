This repo contains functions often used in the Padilla-Coreano lab.

## When a function should be in this Repo:
- The function does not require high performance computing.
- The function does not require a highly specialized environmnet to run in.
- The primary purpose of the function is to process data and not to plot data.
- The function is used multiple times in the lab.
- The function is used on multiple devices.

## The code in this repo has the following formatting and updating rules:
- We use git flow to expand the code upon.
- We use PEP8 to style our code using the standard falke8 linter.
- Unit testing is not required as of yet.
- all functions have to have docstrings describing the input variables and output variables.
- the type of each varaible needs to be given as well as a description of the information it carries.

## To Do:
- Add all functions to modules in packcage
- Publish first version of the package
- Add classes where necessary
- Clean up functions to suit use and purpose better
- Create small GUI to use some functions
    - Make new Repo for this
    - start with MEDPC2CSV function
    - Use Dockerize GUI
